This is a simple application that will send an SMS message to phone numbers. The intent of this application is to help business owners send SMS after the client has left. These messages would be used to remind the customer to leave a review, schedule the next visit or anything else. It integrates Twilio to send out SMS. *the repo does not show a hidden keys file that has the tokens needed to connect to Twilio
